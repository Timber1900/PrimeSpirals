# PrimeSpirals
As of the request of u/Gevorg999 I created a githb repository for the prime spiral visualisation I posted on r/Math.

Warning:
  The visualization is very slow, not only because its javascript but also since every time through draw we have to redraw all 
of the points, the break condition helps, but as the variable amount gets smaller, render time increases.

Feel free to mess around with it and change it to your liking!
Enjoy.
